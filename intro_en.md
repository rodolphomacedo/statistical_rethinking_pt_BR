This stuff is about statistics. Bayesian Statistics! The idea here is to present insights into the Bayesian thinking model.

Many of the models available today are well-tested models used by great people in large companies and institutions. These techniques were built, and widely disseminated, allowing us, statisticians, mathematicians, physicists, engineers, that is, exact science professionals, to see a reasonable way to solve many everyday problems. In this way, data analysis can be seen as if it were a large supermarket of well-tested, reliable and useful techniques for many everyday problems.
Thus, an experienced analyst, having a vast knowledge of various techniques available on these exact supermarket shelves, can choose one of these products - techniques - and apply it to his problem, as long as the assumptions are right.

Just as a packet of rice is in the cereal aisle of a supermarket, these technical products are displayed in their respective aisles. These corridors can also be identified by famous names such as machine learning, deep learning, classical statistics and others. An analyst's understanding of these products and their appropriate choices for each situation is often measured by their degree of seniority in problem solving.

Bayesian statistics is not related to the ability to choose a technique. Bayesian statistics are not on supermarket shelves. It is custom built for each problem. From the factory to the customer.

Bayesian Statistics is a tool that allows us to reason, think and understand some threads of wisdom within the complexity of Nature.
